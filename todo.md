# TODO

- Analyze sequences for prop, full, and hand reversals
- Standardize naming conventions automatically - reassemble pictographs
  - Allow users to select from the middle of a circular sequence when constructing an act
- Allow user-defined names for sequence variations
- Customize pictograph thumbnails for prop type or visibility
- Save all sequence variations as images or SVGs
- Make the menu bar change depending on what widget it's inside
- More customizable variables in the browser options panel
- Split the Learn tab into levels
- Fix the show label's options to be a series of buttons in the option Picker that are toggleable.
  - Filter by Red Reveral, Blue Reversal.
- Make the graph editor collapsible
- Put the cheat sheet in the Learn Tab
- When the user is prompted to choose their start position, then the orientation pickers within the graph editor should apply to the pictographs they are being shown in the start position picker.
- When the user clicks create sequence and the sequence is already full, Overwrite the sequence which is in the beat frame. Add a checkbox below the create sequence button. And if that check box is checked, Then it overwrites.

Game plan:

- Move the settings into a settings tab with a gear. This means also moving the socials buttons and spreading them out. 
- move the layout options into the settings.
- Add an undo feature
